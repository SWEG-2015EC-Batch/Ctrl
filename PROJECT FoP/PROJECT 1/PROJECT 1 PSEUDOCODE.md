  - INPUT: read n
             - n number of students,
             - first name, last name,
             - performance hours for 7 days
             - individual- 0, 1, or 2 to see specific information
             - Read roll number, i+1
             - read first name and last name
             - Read m to continue or to end
  - OUTPUT:
             - Display name, each day performance, total hours, and average in tabular form
             - Display name, each day performance, total hours in tabular form based on the given roll number
             - Display name, each day performance, total hours in tabular form based on the given name
  - OPERATION:
              - Read n - number of students
              - Accept first name, last name, performance hours for 7 days
              - Initialize i=0 
              - Check i=n
              - False goto Accept first name, last name, performance hours for 7 days 
              - Calculate total hours of performance for n students
              - Calculate average for each days
              - Display name, each day performance, total hours, and average in tabular form
              - Read individual 0, 1, or 2 to see specific information
              - If individual=1, read rol.no/i+1
              - Display name, each day performance, total hours in tabular form based on the given roll number
              - If individual=2
              - read first name and last name
              - Display name, each day performance, total hours in tabular form based on the given name
              - If individual=0 , End the program
              - Read m to continue or to end
              - If m=0 End the program
              - If m is other number read individual              

   # PSEUDOCODE 
   - STEP1:Start
   - STEP2:Read n - number of students
   - STEP3:Accept first name, last name, performance hours for 7 days
   - STEP4:Initialize i=0
   - STEP5:Check i=n,if it Is false go to step 2
   - STEP6:if it is true Calculate total hours of performance for n students
   - STEP7:Calculate average for each days
   - STEP8:Display name, each day performance, total hours, and average in tabular form
   - STEP9:Read individual 0, 1, or 2 to see specific information
   - STEP10:If individual=1
   - STEP11:read rol.no/i+1
   - STEP12:Display name, each day performance, total hours in tabular form based on the given roll number
   - STEP13:If individual=2
   - STEP14:read first name and last name
   - STEP15:Display name, each day performance, total hours in tabular form based on the given name
   - STEP16:If individual=0 , End the program
   - STEP17:Read m to continue or to end
   - STEP18:If m=0 End the program
   - STEP19:If m is other number goto step-9
