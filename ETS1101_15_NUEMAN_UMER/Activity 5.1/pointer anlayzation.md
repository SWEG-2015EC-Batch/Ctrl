- Invalid statements

Invalid statements:
*p1 = 20 (assigning an integer (20) to a pointer (p1) is not allowed)
*p2 = 50 (p2 is a pointer to a constant integer so, the value it points to cannot be modified.)
p3 = &y (p3 is constant pointer so, its address cannot be changed)
p4 = &y (p4 is constant pointer so, its address cannot be changed)
*p4 = 90 (p4 is a pointer to a constant integer so, value it points to cannot be modified
