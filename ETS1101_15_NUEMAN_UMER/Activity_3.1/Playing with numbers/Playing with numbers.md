                Analysis
Input: The program prompts the user for an integer and a choice from a menu to perform various operations on the entered number.

Process: The program utilizes a switch statement to execute different operations based on the user's choice:

Reverse the number.

Count the number of digits.

Calculate the sum of digits.

Calculate the product of even digits.

Print First and last digit and their sum.

Swap the first and last digits.

Check if the number is a palindrome.

Count the frequency of each digit.

Check if the number is an Armstrong number.

Check if the number is a Strong number.

Check if the number is a Perfect number.

Output: The program displays the result of the chosen operation.

            Algorithm Design (Pseudocode)

"5. Print First and last digit and their sum"

"6. Swap first and last digit"

"7. Check if it is palindrome"

"8. Digit frequency"

"9. Check if it is Armstrong number"

"10. Check if it is Strong number"

"11. Check if it is Perfect number"

Prompt user for input: "Enter your choice: "
Read user input and store it in the variable choice
Switch on the value of choice:

a. Case 1: Reverse the number.      Implement reverse number logic

b. Case 2: Count number of digits.   Implement digit count logic

d. Case 4: Product of even digits.    Implement product of even digits logic

e. Case 5: Print First and last digit and their sum.     Implement logic to extract and sum first and last digits

f. Case 6: Swap first and last digit.    Implement logic to swap first and last digits

g. Case 7: Check if it is palindrome.        Implement palindrome check logic

h. Case 8: Digit frequency.  Implement digit frequency logic

i. Case 9: Check if it is Armstrong number. Implement Armstrong number check logic
 
j. Case 10: Check if it is Strong number.  Implement Strong number check logic

 k. Case 11: Check if it is Perfect number.   Implement Perfect number check logic

l. Default: Display "Invalid choice."
