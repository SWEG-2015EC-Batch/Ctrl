PROBLEM ANALYSIS
INPUT=transmition rate,number of bytes
OUTPUT=time taken in second, time taken in hour, time taken in day
OPERATION/PROCESS
    read number of bytes
    define transmition rate as constant
    calculate time taken in second=numberofbytes/transmission_rate
    calculate timetakeninhour=timetaken/3600
    calculate timetakenindays=timetakeninhour/24
    display the result
