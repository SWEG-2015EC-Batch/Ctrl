algorithm
Input= x and y
output= x the power of y
operation= read x and y, set result variable to 1, loop from i=0 toi < y:, with in loop multiply the result by x,display result as x the power of y.

Pseudocode
step1= start
step2= input x and y
step3= set result variable to 1
step4=loop from i=0 toi< y:
with in loop multiply the result by x.
step5=display result as x the power of y.
step6=end
